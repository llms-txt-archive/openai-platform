# Integrating Sign in with ChatGPT in your Opensource App

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

[Sign in with ChatGPT](https://developers.openai.com/siwc) lets users sign in to your app with their ChatGPT account and, when eligible, use their ChatGPT plan to power its AI features. Eligible ChatGPT Plus and Pro users can try your tool with the account and plan they already have, without creating or configuring an API key.

The integration supports two distinct capabilities. **Identity** provides verified account information so users can sign up or sign in to your app. **[ChatGPT plan usage](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source)** is an optional permission to complete eligible AI requests with usage included in the user’s ChatGPT plan or available credits. Users choose whether to grant that permission and manage app access and usage in ChatGPT settings. Neither capability grants access to their ChatGPT conversations.

For open-source developers, this removes a setup hurdle between sharing a tool and someone using it. You can focus on building a useful **harness**—the tools, context, and workflows around a model—whether that’s a coding assistant, a research tool, or a desktop utility. Supporting these integrations is part of our commitment to open source: developers can build and share new experiences, and users can bring their existing plan to the tools they choose.

**At launch**, ChatGPT plan usage is available to open-source projects, personal projects that run locally, and selected private apps. Identity-only integration is currently offered to a select group of commercial partners. See the [Sign in with ChatGPT quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/quickstart) for integration options and availability.

## Add ChatGPT sign-in to Paste Perfect

Say you’ve built **Paste Perfect**, an open-source desktop app that rewrites copied text before pasting it. A user copies some text, chooses a recipe, and pastes the rewritten result into the app they’re using. You want to share it with your friends, but asking them to create and configure an OpenAI API key, set up billing, and pay for usage adds significant friction, especially for people who aren’t technical.

With Sign in with ChatGPT, friends with an eligible ChatGPT Plus or Pro plan can download your app, sign in, and use their plan allowance for rewrites. This cookbook walks you through adding that integration to the app you’ve already built. Follow along with the [complete Paste Perfect implementation](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/tree/main/examples/paste-perfect).

Here’s how it works from start to finish. First, your app creates a unique identifier for its installation on the user’s device. Next, the user signs in to ChatGPT in their browser, chooses an account and workspace, and gives your app permission to use their plan. OpenAI then registers the connection and returns the user to your app. Your app saves the connection locally so the user can use it again. Finally, the user asks Paste Perfect to rewrite some text, and your app uses their ChatGPT plan allowance to return the result.

We want to give users a clear way to connect their ChatGPT account from within the app. Before they sign in, show a **Continue with ChatGPT** button. After sign-in, show their connected account. If they’ve enabled ChatGPT plan usage, confirm that it’s enabled and provide a **Manage usage** action.

## Before you start

Paste Perfect is an Electron desktop app with a React interface for accounts, settings, and recipes. Its main process handles sign-in, stores credentials, and sends AI requests; a small bridge lets the interface call these functions without receiving tokens. You’ll add a Sign in with ChatGPT button that lets users connect their account and approve ChatGPT plan usage for the app’s text rewrites.

Before you get started, you will need two things:

- The [devkit repository](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit#readme), downloaded and set up using its instructions for the Paste Perfect desktop app.
- A ChatGPT Plus or Pro account to test sign-in and ChatGPT plan usage.

## 1. Prepare the app’s host ID

A [host ID](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source#a-client-vs-an-agent-host) identifies one installation of your app on a user’s device. Before the first sign-in, the local runtime generates a random UUID in the form `urn:uuid:…` and saves it in `chatgpt-host.json` in the app’s ChatGPT storage directory. It reuses that ID across restarts and account switches. Each installation gets its own host ID.

Paste Perfect creates its ChatGPT runtime with `createChatGPT` in [electron/main.ts](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/examples/paste-perfect/electron/main.ts). Keep this instance in the main process, where it manages authentication, protected local storage, and API requests. Set `sendHostId: true` in its configuration so the runtime includes the saved host ID when it opens the browser for authorization. Keep the existing storage and browser settings; the complete example already includes this option.

The configuration change is:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```diff
 const chatgpt = createChatGPT({
   appName: 'Paste Perfect',
   appId: 'paste-perfect',
+  sendHostId: true,
```

Your app now sends the same saved host ID on later sign-ins. **The app generates the host ID; OpenAI issues a separate client ID during sign-in.** The next step saves that client ID for reuse with the account’s registration.

## 2. Register the client during sign-in

Connect the sign-in button to [`chatgpt.signIn()`](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/local/src/index.ts#L156), the SDK method that runs browser sign-in and returns the connection state. The devkit’s [`@siwc/react` components](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/tree/main/packages/react) provide the button, connection card, and usage links. In Paste Perfect, the card’s `onConnect` callback reaches the main process through the [preload bridge](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/examples/paste-perfect/electron/preload.ts); the existing sign-in handler calls `chatgpt.signIn()`. You can reuse this wiring while the SDK handles OAuth and credential storage.

The runtime starts a callback listener on `127.0.0.1` and opens the system browser with fresh state, nonce, and PKCE values. For a new profile, it sends `client_id=dynamic_agent_client`, `agent_name_hint=Paste Perfect`, and the saved `ext_agent_host_id`. The user signs in, selects a workspace, and reviews the requested permissions. OpenAI registers the client during this flow, so you don’t need a client secret or an API key.

The request includes identity scopes to identify the account, `offline_access` to request a refresh token, and `resource.invoke` with `chatgpt.tokens.use.direct` to request API access using the user’s ChatGPT plan. The resource is `https://api.openai.com/v1`. After approval, the SDK exchanges the authorization code for tokens and checks the permissions OpenAI actually granted.

The [registration and sign-in guide](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/sign-in) covers the full authorization flow. The SDK handles three steps when the browser returns; these excerpts from the [authorization implementation](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/local/src/oauth.ts) show what happens inside `chatgpt.signIn()`:

1. **Save the issued client ID.** The callback returns the authorization code and `client_id`. Before exchanging the code, the runtime saves the registration in `chatgpt-auth.json`. If the code expires, a later attempt can reuse the issued client ID.

   <!-- prettier-ignore -->
   ```ts
   const callback = await listener.result;
   await options.onRegistration?.(callback.clientId);
   ```

2. **Exchange the code for tokens.** The SDK sends the code, issued client ID, and PKCE verifier to the token endpoint. The response supplies the identity and credentials needed to complete sign-in.

   <!-- prettier-ignore -->
   ```ts
   const data = await tokenRequest(new URLSearchParams({
     grant_type: "authorization_code",
     client_id: callback.clientId,
     code: callback.code,
     code_verifier: verifier,
     redirect_uri: listener.redirectUri,
     resource: RESOURCE,
   }), signal);
   ```

3. **Verify identity and permission.** The SDK checks that an ID token is present, then verifies its signature, issuer, audience, and nonce before saving the profile.

   <!-- prettier-ignore -->
   ```ts
   const identity = await verifyIdentity(data.id_token, callback.clientId, nonce);
   ```

   The returned session’s `sharing` flag is true only when the profile is connected, has credentials, and includes the granted `chatgpt.tokens.use.direct` scope. Use that flag to enable AI requests; a successful identity sign-in alone does not grant permission to use the user’s ChatGPT plan.

The user is now back in Paste Perfect, where their ChatGPT connection shows **Connected**.

![Paste Perfect after sign-in, showing the connected ChatGPT account.](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/articles/images/sign-in-with-chatgpt/paste-perfect-app.png)

## 3. Save and select profiles

A login profile is a saved ChatGPT connection that a user can return to or switch between. It keeps the issued client ID, verified account identity, credentials, granted permissions, and token expiry together, so your app can reuse the connection without registering again. Separate registrations stay separate even when their email addresses match. The installation’s host ID stays the same across profiles.

<figure data-cookbook-figure="siwc-identity"><figcaption>One installation host ID shared by two separately registered profiles.</figcaption></figure>

Use `chatgpt.listProfiles()` to populate your account picker. When the user chooses a saved connection, pass its ID to `chatgpt.selectProfile()` and refresh the model picker. Run this code in the main process with your existing `chatgpt` instance; the returned profile list contains display information, not credentials.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
const profiles = await chatgpt.listProfiles();

async function selectAccount(profileId: string) {
  const session = await chatgpt.selectProfile(profileId);
  const models = session.sharing ? await chatgpt.listModels() : [];
  return { session, models };
}
```

See the SDK’s [profile listing and selection methods](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/local/src/index.ts). For **Add account**, call `chatgpt.signIn({ newProfile: true })` to create a separate registration.

If a saved connection needs a new sign-in, pass that profile’s ID to `chatgpt.signIn()`. The SDK opens the browser using its saved client ID and the installation’s host ID, then updates the same profile after verifying the returned identity.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
async function reconnectAccount(profileId: string) {
  return chatgpt.signIn({ profileId });
}
```

The runtime keeps the registration through logout and refreshes tokens when needed for requests. See the SDK’s [`signIn` implementation](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/local/src/index.ts#L156) and [Paste Perfect’s account handlers](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/examples/paste-perfect/electron/main.ts) for the complete wiring. The [accounts and sessions guide](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/profiles-and-sessions) explains account switching, token refresh, and logout.

## 4. Rewrite text using the user’s ChatGPT plan

We need a way to show users which models are available for their selected connection. Call `chatgpt.listModels()` to populate the model picker. Pass the selected model’s `slug`, the copied text, and Paste Perfect’s existing recipe instruction to `chatgpt.streamResponse()`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
const models = await chatgpt.listModels();

async function rewriteText(
  modelSlug: string,
  copiedText: string,
  instructions: string,
) {
  const result = await chatgpt.streamResponse({
    model: modelSlug,
    input: copiedText,
    instructions,
  });
  return result.text;
}
```

The SDK’s [model discovery implementation](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/local/src/models.ts) lists models available to the active connection. Its [stream implementation](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/local/src/responses.ts) sends the request to the public Responses API with that profile’s OAuth access token, collects the text, and returns only after `response.completed`. This gives your app a completed result to use.

Paste Perfect’s [transformation handler](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/examples/paste-perfect/electron/main.ts) connects this request to the existing paste workflow: it combines the recipe and copied text, checks the completed output, and sends it to the destination app. Keep that behavior when adding sign-in. See [models and inference](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/models-and-inference) for the request format and completion requirements.

## 5. Verify ChatGPT Plan Usage

Now we need to verify that the app can complete a request using the user’s ChatGPT plan. Run a small request through the same runtime with this helper, which accepts the app’s existing `chatgpt` instance:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
import type { ChatGPTClient } from "@siwc/local";

export async function verifyTokenSharing(chatgpt: ChatGPTClient) {
  const session = await chatgpt.getSession();
  if (!session.sharing) throw new Error("Enable token sharing first.");

  const [model] = await chatgpt.listModels();
  if (!model) throw new Error("No models are available for this profile.");

  const result = await chatgpt.streamResponse({
    model: model.slug,
    input: "Reply with exactly: Token sharing works.",
  });
  if (!result.text.trim()) throw new Error("The completed response was empty.");
  return result.text;
}
```

Call `await verifyTokenSharing(chatgpt)` in the main process. Expect `Token sharing works.`

Then copy a short message and run Paste Perfect’s existing **Message** recipe. Check that the request completes, returns nonempty text, and reaches the destination app.

<figure data-cookbook-figure="siwc-verification"><figcaption>Illustrative Message recipe output using the connected ChatGPT plan.</figcaption></figure>

A **Connected** badge confirms sign-in, and a populated model picker confirms discovery. Completed inference confirms ChatGPT plan usage worked for that request. If model access fails, check the selected profile and refresh its model list. The [errors and recovery guide](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/errors-and-recovery) explains what to do when a user hasn’t enabled ChatGPT plan usage, reaches a usage limit, or needs to sign in again.

## 6. Help users manage their usage

We need to make sure users can see when their ChatGPT plan is powering their rewrites. Show **Using ChatGPT plan** near the model picker or account controls when requests use the user’s plan. Place a **Manage usage** action beside it that opens [ChatGPT Settings → Usage](https://chatgpt.com/settings/usage) in the browser, where users can review their usage and adjust available limits. If a request reaches a usage limit, make this the primary action in the error message.

You can reuse the [`ChatGPTManageUsageButton` component](https://github.com/openai/sign-in-with-chatgpt-devkit/blob/main/packages/react/src/manage-usage.tsx). Paste Perfect already connects its usage actions through the bridge to the main process’s `open-usage` handler, which opens this URL. Keep the action available in account settings so users can find it between requests. The [UI/UX guidelines](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/ui-ux-guidelines) cover first sign-in, usage controls, and limit messages.
